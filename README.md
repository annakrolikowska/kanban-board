# :clipboard: React Kanban Board


<img src='https://i.ibb.co/CwxsB46/kanban-mokap.png'> 


A **Kanban Board** is a tool that provides a visual system for teams to manage project tasks, workflows and communication.


At first, I carefully considered what I wanted to include in the project and designed the Kanban board's graphic design in **Figma**. Then, using it as a reference, I gradually implemented everything into the code.

[**Here is the link to the live project**](https://annakrolikowska.github.io/kanban-board/) 


 ## :bulb: Project features:
- Adding new tasks using a form, which is **validated**. 
- The form allows users to assign tasks to existing team members and select a task **priority** (low, medium, high). Users can also choose a **color theme** to highlight tasks on the board.
- The Kanban board has four columns, each with a **limit on the number of tasks** that can be added.
- Users can move tasks between columns using **drag and drop**. If a user tries to move a task beyond the column limit, a message will appear indicating that the task cannot be moved.
- Users can also **delete** tasks, and **filter** tasks by priority and team member.
- The project is built using **React**, and the data is saved to **local storage**. The state of the application is managed using **Redux**.
